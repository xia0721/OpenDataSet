# OpenDataSet

The dataset is used in the paper named Modeling Relation Proximity of Passengers Using
Public Transit Smart Card Data authored by Xia Zhao, Yong Zhang, Yongli Hu, etc.

It contains a sample dataset of transit records generated by 41 transit riders in Beijing in Aug. 2015. 

Within it, 35 pairs of passengers are labeled as true positives. 

In case of data privacy, we have to reorder the ID cards of those selected passengers. 

But this anonymity will not affect the replicability of any methods, including ours. 


(1) "OpenTruePositiveCorrelatedCardPairs.csv"
contains all true positive cards whose similarities are quantified from the perspectives of profile similarity, interaction activity, and neighborhood interaction.



(2) "OpenVisCardChains.csv"
The attributes listed in the "OpenVisCardChains.csv" are:

'cardID': the renumbered card Id of every passenger; 

'entry station': the code of a station where one passenger broads; 

'exit station': the code of a station where one passenger alights; 

'entry time': the broading time of this trip;

'exit time': the alighting time of this trip;

'entry longitude': the broading longitude of this trip;

'entry latitude': the broading latitude of this trip;

'exit longitude': the alighting longitude of this trip;

'exit latitude': the alighting latitude of this trip;

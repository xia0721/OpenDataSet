# OpenDataSet

The dataset is used in the paper named Modeling Interpersonal Relations and Patterns Using
Public Transit Smart Card Data. 

It contains 2,319 bus riders in Beijing in Aug. 2015. 

In case of data privacy, we have to reorder the ID cards of those selected passengers. 

But this anonymity will not affect the replicability of any methods, including ours. 

The attributes listed in this table are: 
'cardID': the renumbered card Id of every passenger; 

'entryCode': the code of a station where one passenger broads; 

'exitCode': the code of a station where one passenger alights; 

'date': the specific travel day of this trip. The default month is August; 

'entryTm': the broading time of this trip;

'exitTm': the alighting time of this trip;

'entryLon': the broading longitude of this trip;

'entryLat': the broading latitude of this trip;

'exitLon': the alighting longitude of this trip;

'exitLat': the alighting latitude of this trip;

'entryZn':  the aggregation spatial zone of the entry station;

'exitZn':  the aggregation spatial zone of the exit station.
